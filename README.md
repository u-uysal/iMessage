# :crystal_ball: iMessage App

> This repository is created by using HTML5, CSS3, Firebase and ReactJS .
> One of the main outcomes of this project is figuring out how to create, explore and run a web application in a development environment, then deploying it to the production environment in accordance with **Test-Driven-Development(TDD)** approach.

>Thanks to this application, the user can chat with the person whoever they want after google auth, even if they are online later, they can review the messages again, as the previous messages are saved in the database, and delete the messages they do not want.

## Technology-Tool-Stack

- **React** : React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

- **Timeago** : timeago.js is a nano library(less than 2 kb) used to format datetime with *** time ago statement. eg: '3 hours ago.

- **Firebase** : Firebase is a toolset to “build, improve, and grow your app”, and the tools it gives you cover a large portion of the services that developers would normally have to build themselves, but don’t really want to build, because they’d rather be focusing on the app experience itself. This includes things like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging, and the list goes on. The services are hosted in the cloud, and scale with little to no effort on the part of the developer.
